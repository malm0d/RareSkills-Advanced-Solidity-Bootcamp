// Exploit:
// 1. The ownership of ClimberVault is transferred to ClimberTimelock on deployment.
// 2. Attacking the contract via the sweeper role not possible because we cant change the sweeper address.
// 3. Vault contract only allows withdrawal of 1 ether every `WAITING_PERIOD` (15 days). So even if we
//    became the owner, we can't withdraw all the funds at once. Since we're dealing with a proxy, we can
//    try to become the owner of the contract so we can upgrade it to a malicious `withdraw` function.
// 4. In the `execute` function of ClimberTimelock, function can be called by an arbitrary address.
// 5. The `execute` function first calculates the ID of the operation, meaning it must be scheduled prior.
// 6. The `execute` function then executes all the operations (array of targets, values, dataElements).
//    This is achieved with a low-level call to the target address.
// 7. The `execute` function then check if the operation's id is scheduled, and has the `ReadyForExecution` state.
// 8. The `execute` function sets the operation id as executed (as true).
// 9. If you look closely, theres a reentrancy vulnerability in the `execute` function, since we are making the
//    low-level calls prior to checking the state of the operation.
//
// Attack:
// 1. When `execute` is called and the target is `ClimberVault`, the `msg.sender` in the execution context will
//    be the `ClimberTimelock` contract. So we can encode a `transferOwnership` call to the `ClimberVault` contract
//    to set our attacking address as the owner.
// 2. Now that we have ownership, we can create a malicious contract that will schedule the operation.
// 3. Encode a call to ClimberTimelock to call `grantRole` to give the malicious contract the `PROPOSER_ROLE`.
// 4. Encode a call to ClimberTimelock call the attacking function: `scheduleOp`,  in the malicious contract.
// 5. Inside the `scheduleOp` function in the malicious contract, we need to replicate the same set of encoded
//    function calls: ClimberVault.transferOwnership -> ClimberTimelock.grantRole -> MaliciousContract.schedule.
// 6. Why do we need to repeat the calls?
//    - Firstly, this is because of the id calculated by `getOperationId`, the scheduled operation's id must match
//      the id of the operation that is being executed.
//
//    - Secondly, `getOperationSstate` is designed to enforce a delay between a scheduled operation and its execution.
//      If you schedule an operation, then it can only be executed after the delay has passed. But we want to bypass
//      this delay, so we need to schedule the operation in the same transaction as the execution.
//
//    - Thirdly, because the `execute` function is reentrant, when both the `schedule` and `execute` functions are
//      called in the same transaction (while having the same id), we can bypass the delay and execute the operation
//      that should have been delayed.
//
// 7. To elaborate on the last point:
//    - In the original `execute` call:
//      "ClimberVault.transferOwnership -> ClimberTimelock.grantRole -> MaliciousContract.scheduleOp".
//      The `MaliciousContract.scheduleOp` function is basically a call to the PROPOSER to execute some arbitrary
//      function. Assume that this creates the id: 0xbad.
//      Keep in mind that when `MaliciousContract.scheduleOp` is called in `execute`, the control is handed to 
//      the `MaliciousContract`. The execution context of the `execute` call is now the `MaliciousContract`, and
//      it is not completed yet.
//
//    - In the `MaliciousContract.scheduleOp` function, we replicate the same set of calls:
//      "ClimberVault.transferOwnership -> ClimberTimelock.grantRole -> MaliciousContract.scheduleOp".
//      This will create the same id: 0xbad.
//      However, instead of calling `execute` after contructing the calls in the operation, we call
//      'ClimberVault.schedule` to schedule the operation instead of executing it.
//      Now, this will actually create the schedule for the operation with id: 0xbad, in `ClimberTimelock`.
//      The execution will now return to the original `execute` call, and the `execute` function will complete.
//      From the `ClimberTimeLock`'s perspective, the original `execute` call was intended to call `schedule`, to
//      create a schedule (which it does) but it also successfully called: 
//      "ClimberVault.transferOwnership -> ClimberTimelock.grantRole" before creating the schedule, which will now
//      actually transfer the ownership to the attacker.
//
//    - The trick here was that the `execute` function was reentrant, and the `schedule` function was called in the
//      same transaction as the `execute` function. By calling `execute` first, and then `schedule` in the same
//      transaction, we tricked `ClimberTimelock` into executing the operation that should have been delayed.
//
//  8. Now that we have ownership of the `ClimberVault`, we can upgrade the contract to a malicious version that
//     allows us to withdraw all the funds.
