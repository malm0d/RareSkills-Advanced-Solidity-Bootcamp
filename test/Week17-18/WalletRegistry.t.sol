/// High level overview of how Gnosis safe contracts work: Safe.sol, SafeProxy.sol, SafeProxyFactory.sol:
/// 1. Safe.sol: The main contract that implements the logic for the Gnosis Safe wallet.
/// 2. SafeProxy.sol: A generic proxy contract that allows to execute all transactions applying the code of a master contract.
///    That is, the SafeProxy contract forwards all transactions to the master contract (Safe.sol).
/// 3. SafeProxyFactory.sol: A factory contract that allows to create a new proxy contract and execute a message 
///    call to the new proxy within one transaction.
/// 4. The `Safe` contract is deployed first, and is also referred to as the `singleton` in `SafeProxFactory` and
///    `SafeProxy` contracts.
/// 5. The `SafeProxyFactory` is deployed next.
/// 6. The `SafeProxyFactory` contract is used to deploy new proxy contracts that point to the `Safe` contract.
///    This can be achieved with `createProxyWithNonce` or `createProxyWithCallback` functions.
/// 7. `createProxyWithCallback` calls `createProxyWithNonce` at first, and the `singleton` address, initializer data, and
///    saltNonce are passed to `createProxyWithNonce`.
/// 8. Within the function, `deployProxy` is called,
///    A. First it checks that the `singleton` is deployed
///    B. Then it constructs the creation code for the `SafeProxy` contract with the `singleton` address encoded as the 
///       argument for the constructor.
///    C. It then deploys the contract with `CREATE2` using the `salt` and the creation code.
///    D. Then it makes a low level call to the deployed `SafeProxy`, with the `initializer` data, which will be
///       forwarded to the `Safe` contract. In this case, it will be the encoded data for the `setUp` function in the
///       `Safe` contract.
///    E. Then, `createProxyWithCallback` will call the `proxyCreated` function in the `callback` contract. This contract
///       must implement the `IProxyCreationCallback` interface.
///
/// Exploit:
/// In this ctf, when a new `Safe` wallet is created, we would expect `proxyCreated` to be called in the `WalletRegistry`.
/// So this should be our focus. The `proxyCreated` function does the following:
/// 1. Checks that the registry has enough balance to pay the token payment.
/// 2. Checks that msg.sender is the SafeProxyFactory address that was set up in its constructor.
/// 3. Checks that the `singleton` address used to create the `SafeProxy` is the same as the `masterCopy` address set in
///    the constructor, which should be pointing to the same `Safe` contract.
/// 4. Checks that the `initializer` data is the encoded data for the `setUp` function in the `Safe` contract.
/// 5. Checks that the `Safe` wallet threshold of required confirmations for a Safe transaction is 1 (MAX_THRESHOLD).
///    And that the number of `Safe` wallet owners is 1 (MAX_OWNERS). Only the wallet owner can execute transactions.
/// 6. Checks that the owner of the wallet is registered as a one of the beneficiary in the registry. This prevents
///    the registry from sending tokens to addresses that are not registered as beneficiaries.
/// 7. It removes the beneficiary from the registry to prevent an address from getting more tokens than intended.
/// 8. Finally, it sends tokens from the registry to the `Safe` wallet.
///
/// Essentially, after `proxyCreated` is called, only a `Safe` wallet that has a beneficiary registered in the registry
/// can receive tokens and only receive once.
/// 
/// Thus the exploit is to deploy a `Safe` wallet, register a beneficiary in the registry, and after the registry transfers
/// the tokens to the `Safe` wallet, we need to transfer those tokens out of the `Safe` wallet to the attacker address.
///
/// The first clue is in the `SafeProxy`. The `SafeProxy` contract has a `fallback` function that forwards all calls to
/// the `singleton` address, which is the `Safe` contract. This means that we can call any arbitrary function to the
/// `SafeProxy`, and it will be forwarded to the `Safe` contract. So this means, ultimately, we may want to try to call
/// a transfer like function to transfer the tokens out of the `Safe` wallet.
///
/// The second clue is in the `setup` function in `Safe`, where a function: `internalSetFallbackHandler` is called. The
/// `setup` function has an argument called `fallbackHandler`. This is the address of a contract that will handle all
/// fallback calls made to the `Safe` wallet.
///
/// If we step into `internalSetFallbackHandler`, we see the `FallbackManager` contract. Presumable, this contract is
/// handling all fallback calls made to the `Safe` wallet. In the `FallbackManager` contract, `internalSetFallbackHandler` 
/// sets the `handler` address in the storage slot `FALLBACK_HANDLER_STORAGE_SLOT`. And in the `fallback` function, we see
/// the call: `call(gas(), handler, 0, 0, add(calldatasize(), 20), 0, 0)`. This means that if the `handler` address is set,
/// we can call any function in the `handler` contract by calling `SafeProxy` and the function will be forwarded to the
/// `handler` contract (as a fallback call).
///
/// So the exploit can succeed if when constructing the `initializer` calldata, we pass in the address of the token contract
/// as the `fallbackHandler` in the `setup` function. This way, when`SafeProxyFactory.createProxyWithCallback` is called
/// with that `initializer` calldata, the `Safe` wallet will be created with the `handler` address set to the token contract.
/// And finally, we call just make a ERC20.transfer call to the `SafeProxy`, which will then be forwarded to the `Safe` wallet,
/// and then to the `handler` contract, which is the token contract.
///
/// The success condition requires a `Safe` wallet to be created for each user, and the attacker address to have all the tokens.
